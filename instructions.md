## Brushing Teeth


  1. Pick up toothbrush by handle.
  2. Turn toothbrush so that bristles are facing upward.
  3. Using bathroom sink, run bristles under water, temperature of your choice, for 1 second.

  6. Place toothbrush into mouth and rub bristles with toothpaste against your teeth.
  7. Do this for all parts of your teeth and every tooth in your mouth (both sides as well as the top for bottom teeth and bottom for top teeth)

## Making scrambled eggs (two eggs)

  1. Pick up two eggs and place them inside a bowl. The bowl can be the size of a standard cereal bowl.
  2. Check each egg and make sure they are not already cracked. If eggs are cracked, you may throw out and select a new egg)
  3. Remove the eggs from a bowl and place them in a safe location where they will not break.
  4. With one hand stabilizing the bowl, gentle hit one of the eggs against the rim of the bowl. The hit should be hard enough to crack the egg, but not enough to completely break it.
  5. Open the egg above the bowl. You can do this by using both hands to split the egg open at the point of the crack. Do so carefully to avoid pieces of the shell falling into the bowl. Toss the egg shells in the trash.
  6. Repeat step 5 for the second egg.
  7. With both eggs in the bowl, whisk the eggs until the yolk is well broken up.
  8. Place a skillet onto your oven and turn on the oven to medium heat.
  9. Spread some oil onto the heating skillet. The oil should be spread into the bowl of the skillet.
  10. Allow oil to heat in skillet for a few minutes.
  11. Place the whisked eggs into the hot skillet.
  12. Using a spatula, continuously scramble the eggs as they heat. Do not leave any part of the egg sitting on the skillet without turning for too long (5 seconds) to avoid burning.
  13. Once eggs are a solid yellow color, you can remove the skillet from the burner and turn off the burner.
  14. Place eggs in a dish and enjoy!
